# CyTOF
Analysis of CyTOF data

Mass Cytometry or CyTOF (Cytometry by Time of Flight) is a hybrid of mass spectrometry and flow cytometry technologies for single cell analysis.

Phospho-CyTOF experiment on Blood Cells from the patient and healthy donor. 

Phospho-CyTOF measures the percentage of different blood cells and phosphorylation of 9 kinases and phosphatases under 8 different stimulations.

Stimulants: Unstimulated, IFNa, IL6, IL7, IL10, IL21, LPS & PMA/i.

Phosphorylated Proteins measured: pERK1/2, IKB, pAKT, pP38, pSTAT3, pS6, pSTAT1, pSTAT5 & pPLCg.
